I found that OnShape in pretty easy to get used to with a background in SolidWorks, I enjoy the short cuts. The only trouble I had with this peice was that I dimentioned the holes from the center of the circle rather than the edge and it messed up my linear patern.

I really didn't have any promblemes with this peice I learned how to add a second direction when making a linear patter by selecting second direction and the edge of the face you want it to go in the direction of.

This peice was fairly straight forward, I had to learn the mirror function but as long as the correct plane is selected its easy.
