## Base

I found that OnShape in pretty easy to get used to with a background in SolidWorks, I enjoy the short cuts. The only trouble I had with this peice was that I dimentioned the holes from the center of the circle rather than the edge and it messed up my linear patern.

## Mount

I really didn't have any promblemes with this peice I learned how to add a second direction when making a linear patter by selecting second direction and the edge of the face you want it to go in the direction of.

This peice was fairly straight forward, I had to learn the mirror function but as long as the correct plane is selected its easy.

## Tire

The tire required you to make a piece of symetric geometry and revolve it around the orgin using fillets to create a rounded edge.

## Wheel

The wheel was created similarly to the tire but using different widths to create a hub effect. Then a sketch was laid on the face of the wheel and patterend to create the slats in the it.

## Axle and Collar

This was pretty straight forward I learned how to make an edge of an extruded peice a sketch entity which helped me easily make flat peices on the axle. To add the collar I had to create a new part with in the same piece assembly and make sure it was new not adding.

## Sub Assembly

I learned how to mate using mate connectors which use a refernence like an orgin or edge to estimate what mate you want.

## Final Assembly 
![Screenshot 2020-10-06 at 11 39 17 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55250502/95286338-0d084e80-0831-11eb-94ae-f6ba10ca4231.png)
I used mostly fixed mates to attach the base and mount and then revolute mates to but in the fork, axle, and wheel so that they could move within the assembly.

I forgot to make the extrude symetric but once my pattern didnt work I fixed it. I thought I could do the circular pattern By using the origin as the axis but if you use the little pie looking icon next to the axis entity and select the mate connector it works perfectly. I also learned how to change the color of my parts by going to the left side and selecting the appearnce icon which has three circular signs.

## Final Assembly 2

![Screenshot 2020-10-06 at 11 39 17 PM](![Screenshot 2020-10-13 at 11 01 29 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55250502/95879404-529ead00-0d44-11eb-88a9-ab5cae6855b5.png)

I used mostly fixed mates to attach the base and mount and then revolute mates to but in the fork, axle, and wheel so that they could move within the assembly.
This was quite difficult as i couldnt get the revolute mates to work for a very long time but once i realized it was my bracket mesurments that were off I was able to edit them and with a few quick mates I was done.

## Dorthy's Dowel Pins

This assignment was helpful in figuring out configurations. Although Configurations where pretty simple I had some trouble learning the steps to select which feature I wanted to create a configuration for. I quickly learned to select configure assembly feature and then to select the feature I wanted to edit. I also forgot to make the fram be centered which messes up when I mirrored the hole but I fixed it by selecting the bottom line of the sketch and the origin and then clicking mid point.
