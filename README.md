## Base

I found that OnShape in pretty easy to get used to with a background in SolidWorks, I enjoy the short cuts. The only trouble I had with this peice was that I dimentioned the holes from the center of the circle rather than the edge and it messed up my linear patern.

## Mount

I really didn't have any promblemes with this peice I learned how to add a second direction when making a linear patter by selecting second direction and the edge of the face you want it to go in the direction of.

This peice was fairly straight forward, I had to learn the mirror function but as long as the correct plane is selected its easy.

## TIre

The tire required you to make a piece of symetric geometry and revolve it around the orgin using fillets to create a rounded edge.

## Wheel

The wheel was created similarly to the tire but using different widths to create a hub effect. Then a sketch was laid on the face of the wheel and patterend to create the slats in the it.

## Axle and COllar
This was pretty straight forward I learned how to make an edge of an extruded peice a sketch entity which helped me easily make flat peices on the axle. To add the collar I had to create a new part with in the same piece assembly and make sure it was new not adding. 

## Sub Assembly 

I learned how to mate using mate connectors which use a refernence like an orgin or edge to estimate what mate you want. 

## Final Assembly 

I used mostly fixed mates to attach the base and mount and then revolute mates to but in the fork, axle, and wheel so that they could move within the assembly.
